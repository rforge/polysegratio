  abstract =	 {A population derived from a doubled-haploid
                  backcrossed to its parent has a unique genetic
                  structure, which affects the mapping and genetic
                  analysis of molecular-marker data. In such a cross:
                  (1) repulsion linkages are reduced dramatically and
                  can be detected only in restricted chromosome
                  sections; each repulsion-linkage group represents a
                  section of a chromosome carrying a crossover that
                  occurred in the meiosis that produced the gamete
                  from which the doubled-haploid was derived; (2) the
                  number of coupling-linkage groups observed depends
                  on how many crossovers occurred during the meiosis;
                  the observed size of a linkage group will be only a
                  fraction of a total chromosome if the chromosome
                  carried in the doubled-haploid resulted from
                  crossover exchanges; (3) the size covered by all the
                  observed linkages is only equivalent to the haploid
                  genome; and (4) the ratio of single-dose to
                  multi-dose markers is inflated. These features have
                  not been recognized in previous reports, resulting
                  in misinterpretations in genetic mapping and
                  analysis of the molecular-marker data. The ratio of
                  single- to multi-dose markers has been used
                  inappropriately to distinguish polyploid type.},
