## polySegratioMM: To do's

1) NB: Nearly all code is written assuming only one chain is actually
   run. Code needs to be checked for multiple chains and some will
   need to be modified and some will work

2) rewrite JAGS calling parts so that R2WinBUGS can be used as well 

3) legend option on plotting fitted/theoretical distributions

Previously

2) Major problems encountered compiling jags 0.98 for MinGW under
   windows. Is there an easy way to do this or do I need to have OS
   specific checks and run jags 0.90 under windows?

Now fixed due to release of JAGS 1.0 and 1.01 with Windows binaries
supplied
